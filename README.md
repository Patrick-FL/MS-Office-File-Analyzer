## Background
The MS Office file analyzer has been created as part of an academic security research project. It is a response to the security flaws found in the research. 

## Usage 
It allows an user to put in several files of the MS Office applications PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Access, OneNote and Outlook into the folder "Working Folder". The application then scans all files in that folder. Afterwards a report is generated.   

## No Warranty
The application holds no warranty that a scanned file is secure to open and without any security flaw. 

## Copyright
The MS Office File Analyzer is published as open source. 

Microsoft was not involved in the research or has any stakes in the here published application. I even don't know if they like it.
